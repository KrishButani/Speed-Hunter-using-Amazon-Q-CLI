    Instructions for applying the bug fixes to the Speed Hunter game.

    To fix the bugs in the Speed Hunter game, follow these steps:
    
    1. Open ui.py and replace the draw_needle function with the corrected version.
    2. In ui.py, modify the digital speed readout code to display integer values only.
    3. Open main.py and update the speed increment code to ensure exact 10 km/h increments.
    4. In main.py, modify the reset_game function to reset speed to exactly 10 km/h.
    5. In main.py, remove or comment out the automatic speed increase over time.
    
    After making these changes, the game will:
    - Display speed as integers only (10 km/h, 20 km/h, etc.)
    - Have the speedometer needle accurately reflect the current speed
    - Increase speed in exact 10 km/h increments when collecting 10 coins
    - Always start at exactly 10 km/h
    - Not increase speed automatically over time
    
    These fixes will ensure the speed system works as expected and provides a better
    player experience with clear, predictable speed increments.
